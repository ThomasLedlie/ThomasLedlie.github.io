            <p>Due to the nature of my degree and my interest in Linux and home computers, I purchased a HP Prodesk 600 G2 with an i5-6500T installed. I upgraded the RAM of this PC to have 32GB of LPDDR4, and added an NVME SSD as a boot drive and a 2.5" HDD to serve as bulk storage (this is likely to be swapped for a larger capacity SSD in the near future).</p>
            <p>During my time at University I had taught myself how to set up a Samba shared drive on my Desktop PC which could be accessed on my home network, however by using this Mini-PC, I would be able to access my shared drive at any time whilst only consuming minimal load.</p>
            <p>I installed TrueNAS Scale onto the HP Mini-PC, which is an open source Linux based NAS operating system, which uses a Web UI to install docker apps. By setting my home router to provide this with a static IP addres, meant that I could easily access my files from any device on my home network.</p> 
            <p>Driven by wanting to remotely access my home server, and have it mounted as a drive wherever I was in the world, I purchased a domain through Cloudflare and setup the Cloudflare Deamon in TrueNAS Scale. This alongside setting up WARP on my machines which need to access my services remotely, sets up a ZeroTrust network between my machines routed through Cloudflares servers, hence avoiding portforwarding by using a Tunnel between my local network and Cloudflare's servers.</p>
            <p>For more information on how this service works, Cloudflare provides excellent documentation <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Whilst on placement, I remained involved with several University Societies. Due to the resignation of a former committee member I ran for and joined the committee body where I have been involved in the organising and co-ordination of events as part of the society.</p>
            <p>As part of my time on the committee, I overhauled the Society's Safeguarding procedures, created committee bylaws, collaborated with the other Committee members to make clearer rules, suggested and co-ordinated a collaboration event with Swansea University, created an internal Excel tracker spreadsheet for events and deadlines, created a rule violation record, assisted in the co-ordination of two collaboration events with the University of Bristol for both Bristol Comic Con and a Concert which was held in Bristol.</p>  
            <p>Further to this as part of our typical scheduled events as a Society I aided in creating, validating, and the running of two Quiz nights this academic year which had numerous visitors, including numerous guests from Southampton, Bristol and Swansea. Bristol has also been discussing internally the potential for a Society split to boost the number of attendees, and I was able to offer insight and means by which they could further improve their Society.</p> 
            <p>Finally this academic year I ran the Society communications and advertising for the elections for the next academic year. In spite of the difficulties faced by the SU in advertising the posts correctly or providing sufficient campaigning time, I ensured that fair elections were held, that all candidates were fully informed of their potential duties and endorsed a candidate for SU Executive Treasurer.</p>

This aided substantially in the creation of a Risk Assesment for the team, and the safety team members were focused on its compliance.</p>
            <p>This role permitted the use of my knowledge gained from working in the water industry as an Electrical Design Engineer, and my familiarity with Risk Assesments, and collectively we capitalised on this knowledge resulting in Team Bath Hydrobotics being the first <a href="https://www.facebook.com/materovcompetition/posts/-world-championship-qualifiers-update-may-23-2025-these-teams-have-qualified-to-/1099470765544344/">MATEROV Competition</a> team to qualiy within a year of the team being founded.</p>

          <div class="entry_div">
            <img class="entry_image_left" src="./docs/assets/EE20194_Schem.png" alt="Mouse Race CAD schematic"></img>
            <p>In Year 2 Semester 2 the Module: "" set a group coursework to design, build and compete miniature mose robots against each other in completing a lap of a custom built track in the lab. This mouse was to use search coils to detect the current flow in a wire which was embedded into the track, and it was strongly advised that we use PID control and either an analogue or digital design for the mouse.</p>
            <p>My group opted for a digital design, making use of a Raspberry Pi Pico and its ADC pins to compare volatage levels in the probes. By using op-amps to create both amplifiers and peak detectors, we were able to convert the mA AC volatge indued int each search coil into a detectable DC voltage which the Pi Pico could then comapre and use as the input for its PID control system.</p>
            <p>To assist in writing our report, and to ensure that the wiring was correct, after modelling each part of the mouse on a breadboard, I constructed these parts in a KiCad schematic and was then able to model how to seperate each section of the circuits between boards. This made assembly on veroboard of our circuits drastically more efficient and reduced overall errors. After completing the coursework and as a learning exercise I modelled a PCB design which could have been fabricated (see below).</p>
            <img class="entry_image_left" src="./docs/assets/EE20194_Mouse.jpg" alt="Mouse Race Assembly"></img>
            <p>There were unfortunately several issues with our initial design due to having used an atypical peak detector circuit, this resulted in somewhat tempermental op-amps which would require manual calibration of their gain ratio to ensure that the detected signal is correct and not at the voltage rails. Due to this, and a member of my group being AWOL for the duration of the project my group unfortunately did not have sufficient time to fully calibrate our robot, however in spite of that, we were able to complete a lap of the course on the competition date and placed in the top half.</p>
            <p>Refelcting on this coursework, in future I will put more effort into optioneering and researching solutions before construction, which should alleviate the constraints we faced. I would also be keen to replace the initial design of peak detectors and fabriacte this on a PCB to test out and further develop my understanding of PID tuning.</p>

            <p>In Year 2 Semester 2, a coursework was set to create a python based transmission matrix calculator that takes an input from a file and outputs to a .csv file whilst calculating a range of values across a range of frequencies.</p>
            <p>This courswork made me aware of REGEX, and made use of NumPy, Matplotlib and Pandas. I learned the importance and use cases of docstrings and doctests and the types of code testing.</p>
            <p>Given that I had no prior experience of Python and did not take any formal programming courses until starting my degree, I have come to learn the flexibility and importance of Python in the modern programming landscape.</p>
